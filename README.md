## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio)
- Text editor or IDE (VS Code, Code::Blocks, Dev-C++)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts (helpful but not required)

### How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Basics**: Begin with the `basics/` folder if you're new to C
2. **Follow the Order**: Topics are arranged in logical learning progression
3. **Practice Actively**: Try solving problems before looking at solutions
4. **Compile and Run**: Test every program you write
5. **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on understanding the concepts
