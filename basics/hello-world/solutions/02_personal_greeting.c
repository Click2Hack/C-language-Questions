/*
 * Exercise 2: Personal Greeting
 * Difficulty: Beginner
 * 
 * This program prints a personalized greeting with the programmer's name
 * and a welcome message.
 */

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, my name is Alice!\n");    // Replace Alice with your name
    printf("Welcome to C programming!\n");   // Welcome message
    return 0;
}

/*
 * Explanation:
 * 1. We use two separate printf() statements for clarity
 * 2. \n is an escape sequence that creates a new line
 * 3. Each printf() statement ends with a semicolon
 * 4. The name should be replaced with your actual name
 * 
 * Key Learning:
 * - Escape sequences like \n for formatting
 * - Multiple printf() statements in one program
 * - String literals are enclosed in double quotes
