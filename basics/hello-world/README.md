# Hello World Programs 🌟

Welcome to your first C programming exercises! This section covers the fundamental structure of C programs and helps you write your very first C code.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the basic structure of a C program
- Write and compile your first C program
- Use the `printf()` function for output
- Understand the role of `main()` function
- Include necessary header files

## 📚 Topics Covered

1. **Program Structure**: Understanding the anatomy of a C program
2. **Headers**: Including necessary libraries
3. **Main Function**: The entry point of every C program  
4. **Output**: Using `printf()` to display text

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Program Structure
```c
#include <stdio.h>    // Header file for input/output functions

int main() {          // Main function - program starts here
    // Your code goes here
    return 0;         // Return statement
}
```

## 📝 Exercises

### 🟢 Beginner Level

1. **Hello World** - Write a program that prints "Hello, World!"
2. **Personal Greeting** - Print a greeting with your name
3. **Multiple Lines** - Print text on multiple lines
4. **Formatted Output** - Use escape sequences for formatting

### 🟡 Intermediate Level

5. **ASCII Art** - Create simple ASCII art using printf
6. **Program Information** - Display program name, author, and date

## 💡 Key Concepts

- **#include <stdio.h>**: Includes standard input/output library
- **int main()**: The main function where program execution begins
- **printf()**: Function to print formatted output
- **return 0**: Indicates successful program termination
- **Semicolon (;)**: Statement terminator in C

## 🔧 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Forgetting to include `#include <stdio.h>`
2. Missing semicolons at the end of statements
3. Forgetting the `return 0;` statement
4. Incorrect curly brace placement
